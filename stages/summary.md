## Conclusion

 >The issue with accessing logs within the Splunk server was resolved through collaborative efforts and systematic >troubleshooting. The modifications made to the config.conf file restored functionality to the logging system, aligning with >the objectives of the digital forensics investigation stages. 
 
 >This document details the steps undertaken to identify and resolve the access issue within the Splunk system, explicitly >targeting the misconfiguration present in the config.conf file. By documenting the acquisition, preservation, analysis, and >presentation stages of digital forensics, it offers a comprehensive record of the investigative process.

## Suggestions

To enhance the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of the config.conf file, the following suggestions can be applied:

- Restrict access to the config.conf file based on roles and responsibilities within the organization. Limit access to only authorized personnel who require it for their job functions. This helps prevent unauthorized modifications and ensures only relevant individuals can change the configuration.

- Create a cron job to check and ensure the integrity of the config.conf periodically using the md5sum command.

    ```bash
    # Open the crontab editor
    crontab -e
    # Add the following line to the crontab file to run the integrity check every day at 2 AM
    0 2 * * * md5sum /opt/splunk/etc/system/local/config.conf > /var/log/config_checksum.log
    ```


- Create a cron job to schedule regular backups of the config.conf file to ensure data redundancy and availability.

    ```bash
    # Open the crontab editor
    crontab -e
    # backup
    0 0 * * * tar -czf /backup/config_backup_$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).tar.gz /opt/splunk/etc/system/local/config.conf
    ```




- Regularly Audit File Permissions: Conduct regular audits of file permissions to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege. Review and adjust permissions as necessary to restrict access to the config.conf file to only those individuals who require it for their job roles. This helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and modifications.


- Encrypt Configuration Files: Encrypt the config.conf file to protect sensitive information stored within it. Encryption ensures that even if unauthorized individuals gain access to the file, they cannot decipher its contents without the proper decryption key. This helps safeguard confidential data and maintains the confidentiality of the configuration settings.
